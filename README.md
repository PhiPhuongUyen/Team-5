                    The scatterplot chart is used to analyze and compare the scores of the home team and the away team in matches.
                    
                    Each point on the chart represents a match, with the X-axis representing the home team's score and the Y-axis
                    representing the away team's score. By observing the density of points on the chart and the distribution pattern
                    of those points, we can assess the level of correlation between the scores of the home team and the away team.
                    From the chart, we can see that the points do not have a particular shape (such as straight lines or diagonals line).
                    Although they are mostly concentrated towards the bottom, there are still many scattered points throughout the chart
                    that do not follow a specific rule, making it impossible to determine the direction of the points clearly. Therefore,
                    based on the chart, we can conclude that the number of goals scored and the number of losses for the teams do not have
                    a correlation and do not affect each other.

                     with two different colors for easy distinction. The goals conceded are only around 1.0. goals up to 2.5 This chart allows you to compare
                     the number of goals scored between different teams or players in a specific time frame. You can identify outstanding teams or players with
                     excellent scoring ability. For example, in Brazil and Germany. Depending on your specific goals and the data you have, you can conduct more
                     detailed analysis such as identifying the players who scored the most goals, creating a chart showing changes over time, or comparing performance.

                     Each patch in the chart represents a tournament, and the area of the patch represents the ratio
                     (percentage) of that tournament to the total number of tournaments. By looking at the chart, 
                     you can look at each league's percentage and see which leagues have the largest and smallest percentages.
                     You can determine the most popular tournament by looking at the piece with the largest area in the chart.
                     The slice representing this league has the highest percentage, showing that that league has a larger number
                     of teams than the other leagues in the data set. By comparing the area of the pieces in the chart, you can
                     see the difference in distribution between tournaments. Larger pieces represent tournaments with more numbers,
                     while smaller pieces represent tournaments with fewer numbers.

                    The x-axis represents the month and year, while the y-axis represents the number of points.
                    The red line (-r) represents the number of points scored by the Brazilian team in each month.
                    The dotted black line (':k') represents the number of points conceded by the team.
                    The graph shows the evolution of points scored and points conceded over time for the Brazilian team.
                    And the data from the chart shows that the number of goals scored by the Brazilian team is almost
                    always greater than the number of goals conceded. Therefore, it can be seen that this is a very strong
                    team and its odds of being in the top are hard to argue with.
